### 12 May

* A good set of precommit hooks for Python - [Example yaml](./repo-health/example-precommit.yaml)
*  `core.excludesFile`: Git looks up `git config core.excludesFile` for `.gitignore`,
so you can have a global gitignore too (by passing the `--global` flag)
* In 2025, Python's `ABC` can be replaced with `typing.Protocol` (more flexible!)
    * Protocol is structurally typed: for a protocol P1, every type T that satisfies the requirements
    is assignable to P1
